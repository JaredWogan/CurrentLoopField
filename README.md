# CurrentLoopField
This project was an extra project I worked on for my electricity and magnetism coursework. We are asked to setup the integrals for the magnetic field due to a current loop. I was unable to find a method to evaulate the integrals numerically, thus I turned to python. I wish to return to this project in the future in an attempt to plot the filed in 3D as a vector field.
